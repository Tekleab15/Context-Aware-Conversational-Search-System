# Context-Aware-Conversational-Search-System
A conversational search engine that maintains context across multiple queries. This project leverages SBERT embeddings for semantic search and session-based memory for better query understanding. The implementation is done using Google Colab, making it easy to run experiments and train models in the cloud.
